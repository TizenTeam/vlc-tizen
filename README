# Requirements

* Tizen SDK available on www.tizen.org
* Tizen Extension SDK for Certificate available on the Samsung developer website
  (only if you're using a Samsung device)

# Build libvlc

Define the TIZEN_SDK path  : export TIZEN_SDK=/path/to/tizen-sdk
Define the target TIZEN_ABI: export TIZEN_ABI=armv7l

Launch the ./buildvlc.sh and please be patient, grab a beer or a coffee, since
it's going to take a while. 

# Setting up the IDE

Open the Tizen IDE and import the project directory (the directory containing
this file).

In the project properties, look for the "Path and Symbols" section:
- in the configuration combobox select "All configurations".
- in the "Includes" tab, locate the "GNU C" panel and append
  /${ProjName}/vlc/include to the list and tick the "Is a workspace path" checkbox.
- in the "Libraries" tab add "vlc".
- in the "Library Paths" ensure "/${ProjName}/lib" is there.

If you're using a Samsung device (like the Z1) you must request certificates (even
for development purpose!). Use the "Register Certificate" icon in the IDE toolbar
and request a developer certificate as well as a device certificate.

# Build the VLC app

Connect your device, you should be able to see it in the Connection Explorer, right
click on it and select "Permit to install applications".

Press build and if everything's fine you should end up with the working app on your
device.
